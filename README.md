# Automated-Resume-Classification-System
This project is a Document Classification System that extracts text from resumes, trains multiple ML models, and deploys the best one through a Streamlit app. It classifies resumes into predefined categories and supports single, text-based, and batch predictions, making screening faster and more efficient.
